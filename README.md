# Nutrevo - All-in-One Health Management App

## 1. Overview

Nutrevo will be an Android app that provides a centralized, user-friendly platform for health monitoring and management. It incorporates key health features like calorie and BMI calculators, task-based habit tracking, interactive health seminars, and location-based services for locating local gyms and medical institutions. In order to make healthy living more accessible for everyone, Nutrevo plans to consolidate these resources into an offline-capable application.

## 2. Folder Structure

The repository contains the following key folders:

- **`Documents/`**: Contains project reports and documentation (e.g., *Progress Report 1*).
- **`Implementation/`**: Contains the source code and resources for the application.
  - **`/app/src/main/res/layout/login.xml`**: Login screen UI layout. **(I will add more layouts here)**
  - **`/app/src/main/java/`**: Java code for app functionality (e.g., Login, BMI/Calorie Calculator, Task Tracker, etc.). -> **(I am working on this)**

## 3. Features

## 4. Development Plan

The app will be developed in stages:

1. **UI Design**: Create intuitive user interfaces for each module (login, calculators, task manager, tutorials, etc.).
2. **Backend Implementation**: Develop core features like BMI/calorie calculation, task tracking, and geolocation.
3. **Testing & Feedback**: Perform internal testing followed by user feedback to improve usability and performance.
